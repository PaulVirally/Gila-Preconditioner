## Examples
There is an example script in each folder (Julia and Python) for how
to use the code to generate data.

## Preload
The `preload` folder contains some files that are created by
GilaElectromagnetics to cache the Green's functions.

## Misc
There is code in both Julia and Python, depending on what you prefer
to use. Note that the Python code is not going to play super nicely
with tensorflow, so the best option would really be to do everything
in Julia (with Flux for example), but if you really need everything to
work in Python let me know; I can take a closer look at the
interaction with tensorflow.
